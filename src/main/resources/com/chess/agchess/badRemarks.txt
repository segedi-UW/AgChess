Sucks to be you right now. Lol.
gg ez - I mean that's too bad!
Huh, didn't think you would lose that so badly.
Hate to see that happen, but maybe next time nub.
You'll have that.
Sorry but you know that was a massive failure right?
I mean they had you in the first half, and then the second half too.
Hard to beat people at chess when you don't know how to play, lol.
Maybe try hittin' the books before coming back.
When in doubt, cry it out.
You just received the big suck.
